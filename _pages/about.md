I'm a software engineer focusing on iOS, tvOS and watchOS apps for media, publishing and education. Past projects include video streaming apps, digital comics and magazines, language study-tools and augmented reality apps. I’ve built projects for Discovery Networks, Macmillan Publishing, Education First, the Museum of London and many other organisations.

I plan to use this site to post my thoughts and ramblings on Swift, Apple platform development and anything else that takes my fancy. Hopefully someone, somwhere finds it interesting. :-)
